9.IMPLEMENT THE FINITE WORDS CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM USING BACK-PROPAGATIONALGORITHM

AIM:
To implement thefinite words classification system using Back-propagationalgorithm

DESCRIPTION:
What is backpropagation?
We can define the backpropagation algorithm as an algorithm that trains some given feed-
forward Neural Network for a given input pattern where the classifications are known to us.
At the point when every passage of the example set is exhibited to the network, the network
looks at its yield reaction to the example input pattern. After that, the comparison done
between output response and expected output with the error value is measured. Later, we
adjust the connection weight based upon the error value measured.
