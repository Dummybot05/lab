1. WRITE A RUBY SCRIPT TO CREATE A NEW STRING WHICH IS N COPIES OF A GIVEN STRING WHERE N IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER

AIM:

	To write a program to create A New String Which is N Copies of a Given String Where N is a Nonnegative Integer.

PROGRAM:

def multiple string(str, n)
    return str*n
end
print multiple string('a', 1),"\n"
Print multiple string ('a', 2),"\n"
Print multiple string ('a', 3),"\n"
Print multiple string ('a', 4),"\n"
Print multiple string ('a', 5),"\n"

INPUT & OUTPUT:
Enter multiple string is ‘a’
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa

RESULT:
	Thus the program to create A New String Which is N Copies of a Given String Where N is a Nonnegative Integer.























2. WRITE A RUBY SCRIPT WHICH ACCEPT THE RADIUS OF A CIRCLE FROM THE USER AND COMPUTE THE PARAMETER AND AREA

AIM:
	
	To write a program to radius of a circle from the user and compute the parameter and area.
	
PROGRAM:

Radius = 5.0
Perimeter = 0.0
area = 0.0
print "Input the radius of the circle: "
radius = gets.to_f
Perimeter = 2 * 3.141592653 * radius
area = 3.141592653 * radius * radius
Puts "The perimeter is # {perimeter}."
Puts "The area is # {area}.”

INPUT & OUTPUT:

Input the radius of the circle: 
The perimeter is 31.41592653.
The area is 78.539816325.

RESULT:
	Thus the program to perform Arithmetic, logical and relational Operations is executed and the output is verified.

NOTE: The to_f function in Ruby converts the value of the number as a float.
The puts (short for "put string") is used to display the results of evaluating Ruby code. Puts adds a newline after executing.





















3. WRITE A RUBY SCRIPT WHICH ACCEPT THE USER'S FIRST AND LAST NAME AND PRINT THEM IN REVERSE ORDER WITH A SPACE BETWEEN THEM 

AIM:

	To write a program to user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them .

PROGRAM:
		
puts "Input your first name:”
fname = gets. Chomp
puts "Input your last name: "
lname = gets. Chomp
puts "Hello #{lname} #{fname}"

INPUT & OUTPUT:

Input your first name: narasimha reddy 
Input your last name: engineering college
 Hello engineering college narasimha reddy

RESULT:
	Thus the program to user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.

NOTE: gets is your user's input. chomp is the method to remove trailing new line character i.e. '\n' from the the string. whenever "gets" is use to take i/p from user it appends new line character i.e.'\n' in the end of the string.So to remove '\n' from the string 'chomp' is used.






















4. WRITE A RUBY SCRIPT TO ACCEPT A FILENAME FROM THE USER PRINT THE EXTENSION OF THAT 

AIM:

	To write a program to accept a filename from the user print the extension of that.

PROGRAM:

file = "/user/system/test.rb"
# file name
fbname = File.basename file  
puts "File name: "+fbname 
# basename
bname = File.basename file,".rb"
puts "Base name: "+bname 
# file extention
ffextn = File.extname  file   
puts "Extention: "+ffextn 
# path name
path_name= File.dirname  file 
puts "Path name: "+path_name

INPUT & OUTPUT:

File name: test.rb
Base name: test
Extention: .rb
Path name: /user/system

RESULT:
	Thus the programs to accept a filename from the user print the extension of that.






















5. WRITE A RUBY SCRIPT TO FIND THE GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS


AIM:

	To write a program to find the greatest of three numbers.

PROGRAM:	

x, y,z = 2,5,4
if x >= y and x >= z
    	 puts "x = #{x} is greatest."
else y >= z and y >= x 
     	puts "y = #{y} is greatest."
else 
    	 puts "z = #{z} is greatest."
End

INPUT & OUTPUT:

y = 5 is greatest.

RESULT:
	Thus the program to find the greatest of three numbers.
