6.IMPLEMENT LINEAR REGRESSION USINGPYTHON.

AIM:
To Implement linear regression using python.

DESCRIPTION:
Regression: Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine
learning.There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them
What Is Regression?
Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine
learning.Thereare many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of
them.Regression searches for relationships among variables.For example, you can observe
several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the
features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.This is a
regression problem where data related to each employee represent one observation.The
presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features,
while the salary depends onthem.Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some
phenomenon of interest andTherehave a number of observations. Each observation has two or
more features. Following the assumption
that(atleast)oneofthefeaturesdependsontheothers,youtrytoestablisharelationamongthem.you
need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well. The
dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.The
independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.
LinearRegression:
Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression
techniques. It‚Äôs among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the
ease of interpretingresults.When implementing linear regression ofsome dependent variable
ùë¶on the set of independent variables x= (x1‚Ä¶xr·µ£), where ris the number of predictors, you 
assume a linear relationship between y andx: y= Œ≤0 + Œ≤1x1 + ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶+ Œ≤rxr+ œµ. This equation is
the regression equation. Œ≤0,ùõΩ, Œ≤r·µ£aretheregressioncoefficients, and ùúÄis therandomerror.
Linear regression calculates the estimators of the regression coefficients or simply the 
predicted weights, denoted with b1‚Ä¶br. They define the estimated regressionfunction
f(x) = b0 +b1x1


SOURCE CODE:
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def estimate_coef(x, y):
 n = np.size(x)
 m_x = np.mean(x) 
 m_y = np.mean(y)
 SS_xy = np.sum(y*x) - n*m_y*m_x
 SS_xx = np.sum(x*x) - n*m_x*m_x
 b_1 = SS_xy / SS_xx
 b_0 = m_y - b_1*m_x 
 return(b_0, b_1)
def plot_regression_line(x, y, b):
 plt.scatter(x, y, color = "m",marker = "o", s = 30)
 y_pred = b[0] + b[1]*x
 plt.plot(x, y_pred, color = "g")
 plt.xlabel('x')
 plt.ylabel('y')
 plt.show()
def main():
 x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
 y = np.array([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12])
 b = estimate_coef(x, y)
 print("Estimated coefficients:\nb_0 = {} \
 \nb_1 = {}".format(b[0], b[1]))
 plot_regression_line(x, y, b)
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()


OUTPUT:
Estimated coefficients:
b_0 =1.23636363636
b_1=1.1696969696969
