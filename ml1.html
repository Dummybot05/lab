1.The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 3%. Since there are 5
school days in a week, the probability that it is Friday is 20%.What is the probability that
a student is absent given that today is Friday? Apply Baye’s rule in python to get the 
result. (Ans: 15%)

AIM: To find the probability that a student is absent given that today is Friday.

DESCRIPTION:
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building of data set.
Using the implemented algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers
to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. Naive bayes algorithm is
one of the most popular machines learning technique. In this article we will look how to implement
Naive bayes algorithm using python.
Before someone can understand Bayes’ theorem, they need to know a couple of related concepts first,
namely, the idea of Conditional Probability, and Bayes’ Rule.
Conditional Probability is just what is the probability that something will happen, given that something
else has already happened.
Let say we have a collection of people. Some of them are singers. They are either male or female. If we
select a random sample, what is the probability that this person is a male? what is the probability that
this person is a male and singer? Conditional Probability is the best option here. We can calculate
probability like,
P(Singer & Male) = P(Male) x P(Singer / Male)

What is Bayes rule ?

We can simply define Bayes rule like this. Let A1, A2, …, An be a set of mutually exclusive events that
together form the sample space S. Let B be any event from the same sample space, such that P(B) > 0.
Then, P( Ak | B ) = P( Ak ∩ B ) / P( A1 ∩ B ) + P( A2 ∩ B ) + . . . + P( An ∩ B )      

What is Bayes classifier?

Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes’
theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features in machine learning.
Basically we can use above theories and equations for classification problem.

SOURCE CODE:

probAbsentFriday=0.0
3 probFriday=0.2
# bayes Formula
#p(Absent|Friday)=p(Friday|Absent)p(Absent)/p(Friday)
#p(Friday|Absent)=p(Friday∩Absent)/p(Absent)
# Therefore the result is:
bayesResult=(probAbsentFriday/probFriday)
print(bayesResult * 100)

Output: 15
